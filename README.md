# 📊 Student Performance Analysis with Pandas

A data analysis project using **Pandas** to explore, clean, and extract insights from a dataset of 1000+ students' academic records.

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:
- Demographics (Name, Age, Gender)
- Academic scores (Math, Physics, CS)
- Attendance (%)
- Pass/Fail status

---

## ✅ What This Project Covers

- ✅ Handling missing values (ID, Gender)
- ✅ Filtering based on multiple conditions
- ✅ Group-wise aggregations
- ✅ Feature Engineering (`Total Marks`, `Result` column)
- ✅ Sorting and ranking
- ✅ Custom conditions (e.g., students under 18 with avg > 70)
- ✅ Value counts, averages by gender
- ✅ Detecting logical patterns and failures (e.g., high attendance but failed)
- ✅ Use of `apply()` with lambda

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- Average scores for male vs female students
- Top 5 students by average score
- Students who scored above 80 in both CS and Math
- Students older than 20
- Created custom pass/fail indicator
- Counted how many students passed despite low attendance
